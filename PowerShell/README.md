#  PowerShell

This is my PowerShell settings

## Usage

- A dense-looking `l` in comparison to `dir` in PowerShell .
- Instead of `cd`, use `c` to visit directory .
  - Each time you `c` to a directory, it will auto `l` for you .
  - Whenever you start a new PowerShell, it will start at the path which you have visited last time by `c` .
- Use `Hotspot-Start` (`Hotspot-Stop`) to start (stop) sharing hotspot .
- Alias `p` for `python`, `ip` for `ipython` .

## Installation

Copy the file `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` into `$PROFILE` .
